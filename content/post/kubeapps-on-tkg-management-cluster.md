This is part two of a series detailing the steps required to run [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com) on a [VMware TKG](https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid) management cluster (on AWS) configured to allow users to deploy applications to multiple
workload clusters, using the new multicluster support in Kubeapps. Though details will differ, a similar configuration works on other non-TKG multicluster setups as well.

The first post described [setting up your VMware TKG management cluster with two OpenIDConnect-enabled workload clusters]( {{< relref "tanzu-kubernetes-grid-tkg-first-experience" >}}). This post assumes you have your TKG environment setup as described there and focuses on the Kubeapps installation and configuration.

## Prepare a Kubeapps configuration

We'll need two random values for the client and cookie secret required as part of Kubeapps' oauth2-proxy configuration, so generate these values with:

```bash
kubeappsClientSecret=$(openssl rand -base64 32) && echo $kubeappsClientSecret
kubeappsCookieSecret=$(openssl rand -base64 32) && echo $kubeappsCookieSecret
```

Next, create a `kubeapps-tkg-values.yaml` file with the following contents, substituting in the same values from earlier steps:

```yaml
# Ensure that Kubeapps is reachable externally via the frontend svc as an ELB
# currently without TLS.
frontend:
  service:
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: http
    port: 80
    type: LoadBalancer

# Setup the oauth2-proxy running on the frontend to handle the OIDC authentication
# for us.
authProxy:
  enabled: true
  provider: oidc
  clientID: kubeapps-oauth2-proxy
  clientSecret: <KUBEAPPS_CLIENT_SECRET>
  cookieSecret: <KUBEAPPS_COOKIE_SECRET>
  additionalFlags:
    - --oidc-issuer-url=https://<DEX_SVC_LB_HOSTNAME>
    # IMPORTANT: We are overwriting the scope option to include the workload clusters' clientids in the audience.
    - --scope=openid email groups audience:server:client_id:my-oidc-cluster audience:server:client_id:second-oidc-cluster
    # TODO: Update to provide the dex ca via --provider-ca-file and mounting etc.
    - --ssl-insecure-skip-verify=true
    # Since Kubeapps is running without TLS, can't use secure cookies
    - --cookie-secure=false
    # If you need to access the actual token in the frontend for testing, uncomment the following.
    # - --set-authorization-header=true

# Configure the two workload clusters
clusters:
  - name: my-oidc-cluster
    apiServiceURL: https://<DNS of first workload cluster API Server>:6443
    certificateAuthorityData: <CA Data for first cluster>
  - name: second-oidc-cluster
    apiServiceURL: https://<DNS of second workload cluster API server>:6443
    certificateAuthorityData: <CA Data for second cluster>

```

As noted in the comments there, the most important part for the `authProxy` is the `--scope` argument which requests not only the normal `openid email groups` scopes but also requests that the workload client ids be included in the audience of our `kubeapps-oauth2-proxy` token. More about this below.

For the `apiServiceURL` and `certificateAuthorityData` values for Kubeapps' `clusters` configuration, you have this data all in your kubeconfig, so grab it from there:

```bash
less $KUBECONFIG
```

With the kube-context set for the management cluster, we create a namespace for Kubeapps and install away!

```bash
kubectl create ns kubeapps

helm install --namespace kubeapps kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps --values ~/path/to/your/kubeapps-tkg-values.yaml
```

Once the pods are all up and running, check for the frontend loadbalancer domain name given by AWS:

```bash
kubectl -n kubeapps get svc kubeapps
```

and open it up in a browser to verify that you can see kubeapps at that address. Note that logging in wil result in a bad request until we update Dex's configuration.

## Configuring a Kubeapps client for Dex

The last step is to edit the Dex config adding a `kubeapps-oauth2-proxy` client and importantly, ensuring that Dex views the `kubeapps-oauth2-proxy` client as a trusted peer of each cluster client. This allows us to request that the cluster client-ids be included in the audience of the returned token for the `kubeapps-oauth2-proxy`, which in turn enables the API servers of each cluster to trust a token issued to the `kubeapps-oauth2-proxy` client.

So we edit the same Dex configuration file which we previously worked with while setting up the authentication for our TKG clusters:

```bash
vim tkg-extensions-v1.1.0/authentication/dex/aws/oidc/04-cm.yaml
```

and add a second static client for the second workload cluster (the name must match the name of your second workload cluster, but you don't need any other secret or redirect URIs since we didn't install Gangway on the second workload cluster) and a third static client for the `kubeapps-oauth2-proxy`. Note that the client entry for both clusters are listed as trusted peers of the `kubeapps-oauth2-proxy` client:

```yaml use highlight functionality.
    staticClients:
    - id: my-oidc-cluster
      redirectURIs:
      - 'https://<existing value for the DNS of the API server for my-oidc-cluster>/callback'
      name: 'my-oidc-cluster'
      secret: <existing value for clientSecret for my-oidc-cluster>
      trustedPeers:
      - kubeapps-oauth2-proxy
    - id: second-oidc-cluster
      trustedPeers:
      - kubeapps-oauth2-proxy
    - id: kubeapps-oauth2-proxy
      redirectURIs:
      - 'http://<kubeapps frontend dns entry>/oauth2/callback'
      name: 'Kubeapps on TKG test Login'
      secret: <kubeappsClientSecret>

```

While editing this file, if you're using Google as your upstream identity provider, I recommend making one further change to ensure dex only allows authentication for emails from a specific domain. In the `config` section of the `oidc` connector, uncomment and set the following to match the email domains which you want to allow, for example:

```yaml
        hostedDomains:
        - vmware.com
```

Bounce dex by deleting the dex pod after applying the config:

```bash
kubectl apply -f tkg-extensions-v1.1.0/authentication/dex/aws/oidc/04-cm.yaml
kubectl -n tanzu-system-auth delete po -l app=dex
```

With this, Dex will successfully authenticate, but Kubeapps still won't let you in because your user doesn't yet have access to the cluster. So switch to the first workload cluster and create the RBAC to give yourself `cluster-admin`:

```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-mnelson --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=mnelson@bitnami.com
```

and then repeat after switching context to your second workload cluster.

When you now login to Kubeapps, you should be presented with the UI including the option to switch between your clusters!

Well done! Of course, there are many points for errors which would require debugging here. If there's a need, I'll follow up with a common issues and how to debug.
