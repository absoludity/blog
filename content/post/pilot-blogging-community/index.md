I love learning together with others who are going through similar experiences and working through similar things. **It's incredibly helpful to be able to write, *interact* and help each other learn**. 

At the same time, I want to **own, collect and build my own learning**, so writing online with a blog website is ideal, even though it doesn't have the same immediate reactions that social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram do.

I also want to control what I see - **I want to curate the list of blogs and authors that I learn from**. Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is web format that was created over 25 years ago for this exact reason. It gained popularity initially, but threatened to take advertising revenue by allowing people to see only the content that they chose to see, without having to visit a website to see it. As a result it has dwindled in popularity but is still in use. Nearly all blogging software supports it.

But when looking around the online piloting community, all **I seem to find are either aviation influencers on social media platforms, or commercial businesses actively maintain a blog**. There are a few non-active Australian pilot blogs ([Mid-life pilot](https://makingtimeforflying.blogspot.com/), [A need for speed](https://aneedforairspeed.wordpress.com/), [Making time for flying](https://makingtimeforflying.blogspot.com/)), but I only found a handful of active Australian pilot blogs like [Stefan Dury's blog](https://www.stef747.com/blog/) or my own instructor's [Fly like a girl blog](https://www.flylikeagirl.com.au/blog).

I'll keep looking and look further afield, but I'm not ready to give up. If you have or know of a pilot learning blog, let me know!
