## Theory, theory and more... theory

The winds just wouldn't cooperate today, even for learning reverse launches in the paddock. We all got up ready to go, packed in the basher 4WD with our gear in the trailer, but didn't even leave. The winds at the top of the mountain were getting stronger rather than weaker over the past half-an-hour, so that it was currently gusts of 30km/h or 8m/s. So we came inside to do more theory. We headed out to the paddock before lunch to learn reverse launches with Bob, but the wind in the paddock then died down so we couldn't practise the new skill, so back inside for more theory. We headed out to the paddock again in the late afternoon when the wind had picked up a bit but again it died off on us and we were left standing there:

There was a slight chance the winds would turn before sunset, but that didn't eventuate either.

**Disclaimer**: I'm taking notes for my own personal reference and learning while it's fresh, but it's totally possible I've remembered incorrectly and have made mistakes. These are not notes for others to learn from but may give an interested passer-by who is considering a course a good idea about how valuable the course at Manilla is. If you're interested in learning to paraglide, I'd totally recommend this live-in [9-day course at FlyManilla](https://www.flymanilla.com/ManillaParaglidingSchool/tabid/141/Default.aspx) (but have zero experience with any other courses, of course).

The little practical skills that I did learn on day 5 were related to the reverse launch technique taught in Australia, which is slightly different to that in the textbook by Dennis Pagan:

1. Layout the glider, untangle and connect your harness as normal (ie. forward facing)
2. Step back (not on the lines) and lift the right riser above your head, turning to face the glider with the right risers on top
3. Take your right brake in your right hand and your left brake in your left hand
4. Take the rear risers of both into your left hand, laying them together so that the quick links are flat and together, holding them in a good grip
5. With your right hand reach under the risers to take the A's of both, holding them similarly flat with the quick links together in a good grip

Check that you can now lift the A's cleanly, building a small wall. If the leading edge risers on one side first, step towards that side and try again (in doing so you are adjusting the tension in the lines).

When there's the right wind, step back and guide the wing up past the power zone (it may pull you forward while passing through) until it's above your head. You control the glider in this position just as if you were balancing a big broom on your left hand (the one holding the rear risers), moving your left hand and your feet to stay under the centre pooint of the glider (usually the logo).

Pull long and hard with your left arm to bring the glider back down (it feels like a huge amount of brake pressure in this position, but this is because you've go the rear risers, not just the brakes). *Importantly*, step towards the wing as it comes down to leave the leading edge open ready for the next inflation, rather than collapsed forward and needing help.
