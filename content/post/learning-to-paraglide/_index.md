After a lifetime of wanting to fly and months of waiting since deciding to learn, I was finally up at [FlyManilla](https://flymanilla.com/) learning to fly a paraglider with 10 other keen wannabe fledglings under Chief Flying Instructor of Godfrey Wenness and two other flying instructors Karl and Bob. Though I'd been looking forward to this for a while and reading as much as I could to prepare, nothing beats being shown the details from years of experience with real equipment that you can touch and try - which is exactly what we were doing on our first day.

I've been hanging around the Blackheath launch site for a while with a friend of mine who's a relatively new pilot of 3 years, getting to know people and even doing a tandem flight with another friend. When I mentioned that I was keen to learn, one of the safety officers there recommended that to fly at an inland flying site like Blackheath you really should do your course inland and one of the best places to learn is Manilla, right here in NSW.

**Disclaimer:** This is an 8 part series detailing what I learned and experienced recently while undertaking the fantastic paragliding course with the team at [FlyManilla](https://flymanilla.com/). You can find links to the details for each day below. I'm taking notes for my own personal reference and learning while it's fresh, but it's totally possible I've remembered incorrectly and have made mistakes. These are not notes for others to learn from but may give an interested passer-by who is considering a course a good idea about how valuable the course at Manilla is. If you're interested in learning to paraglide, I'd totally recommend the course.

Now with over 4 hours in the air and over 30 launches and landings including thermalling and ridge soaring, lots of theory and ground handling to continue learning, a bunch of fellow fledglings to occasionally fly with when we're at the same site, I now have my PG2 Supervised pilots license. This means I can fly under the supervision of a safety officer when they say it's safe for my experience. I'm looking forward to buying my wing and joining the local club!
