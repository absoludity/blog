I'm currently travelling at nearly 300km/h through the Spanish country-side on my way to
[Seville][seville] to meet some of the [Bitnami][bitnami] team, but it's not the speed
which has me surprised, but the willingness of people to engage with total nearby strangers.

Australia used to be known for this (with the clich√© example of Mick Dundee walking down
a New York street greeting tipping his hat to each person he passes, in the 1986 movie
[Crocodile Dundee][crocodile-dundee]), but it's long enough ago that witnessing
it here seems strangely foreign to me. The two interactions I've witnessed in
the few hours I've been here weren't deep or long discussions, but both
involved a bunch of strangers conversing openly for a minute or two about
something on a train.

What's changed in Australia - or at least Sydney and the surrounds - that
people tend to avoid interacting like this? It's not that it never happens in
Sydney, but it's rare and people are wary - myself included - but I'm just not
sure what we're wary of... being dragged into a conversation from which we
can't escape, perhaps?
