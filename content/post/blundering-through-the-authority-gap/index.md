Read the close-call [Blundering through the Authority
Gap](https://www.flightsafetyaustralia.com/2025/10/blundering-through-the-authority-gap/)
from the Flight Safety Australia website where one pilot describes, as a young
pilot, their passenger stepping into the role of co-pilot and navigation expert
in a bad weather situation.

I was recently studying the Risk Management chapter of the FAA's [Aviation
Instructor's
Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/aviation_instructors_handbook),
according to which, one of the principles of risk management is

> ## Make Risk Decisions at the Appropriate Level
> Anyone can make a risk decision. However, risk decisions should be made by the
> person who can develop and implement risk controls. In a single-pilot situation,
> **the pilot makes the decision to accept certain levels of risk, so why let
> anyone else—such as ATC or your passengers—make risk decisions for you?**

I had a vague thought of trying to imagine scenarios where that could happen
when, a day or two later, the following close-call experience popped up in my
RSS reader: [Blundering through the Authority
Gap](https://www.flightsafetyaustralia.com/2025/10/blundering-through-the-authority-gap/).
The pilot describes a close-call where they unintentionally handed over their
risk-decision responsibilities in the presence of a passenger willing to push
past VFR limits to get to their destination. It's worth a read (and [Flight
Safety Australia](https://www.flightsafetyaustralia.com/) is worth subscribing
to if you're interested in aviation-related safety matters)
