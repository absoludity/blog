**Disclaimer:** This is part {{ index .Params 0 }} of an 8 part series detailing what I learned and experienced recently while undertaking the fantastic paragliding course with the team at [FlyManilla](https://flymanilla.com/). You can find links to the rest of the details for each day from [my overall course summary](/post/learning-to-paraglide/). I'm taking notes for my own personal reference and learning while it's fresh, but it's totally possible I've remembered incorrectly and have made mistakes. These are not notes for others to learn from but may give an interested passer-by who is considering a course a good idea about how valuable the course at Manilla is. If you're interested in learning to paraglide, I'd totally recommend this live-in [9-day course at FlyManilla](https://www.flymanilla.com).
